In hyperspace, the Legacy Run, a Kaniff Yards Class A modular freight transport of the Byrne Guild, encounters an obstacle and is destroyed. Starships across the galaxy are abruptly knocked out of hyperspace by missiles of debris from the Legacy Run, which also threaten to destroy space stations, moons, as well as planets. The Republic turns to the Jedi for help in saving lives and ending the crisis, and Jedi activity sees a significant increase.","According to Nexus of Power, the Qel-Droma Epics dates the devastation of Ossus to 4000 years before the Imperial Era, which began in 19 BBY per Star Wars: Galactic Atlas. Since the Epics also say that Ossus' devastation took place a one thousand years after the Great Hyperspace War, it could be calculated that the war occurred around 5000 BBY.,  Inside Star Wars: The High Republic: Meet the Jedi Knights and Masters on StarWars.com (backup link),  Star Wars: The High Republic | Announcement Trailer on the official Star Wars YouTube channel (backup link) states that the events of Star Wars: The High Republic, which include the events of The High Republic: A Test of Courage, take place two-hundred years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace. Since Star Wars: Galactic Atlas dates the events of The Phantom Menace to 32 BBY, it can be deduced that the events of The High Republic: A Test of Courage take place around 232 BBY. As Justina Ireland has stated that Avon Starros is twelve years old during A Test of Courage, it could be found that Starros was born around 244 BBY.,  Inside Star Wars: The High Republic: Meet the Jedi Knights and Masters, Part 2 on StarWars.com (backup link)",5,Canon,10,0,PT

The power generator complex also serves as headquarters of the Royal Naboo Security Forces and its Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps, and is unveiled with ceremonies presided by Senator Palpatine of Naboo. With its efficient, mechanistic design breaking with Naboo's tradition, the power generator becomes a popular attraction with its tours while mining much more than needed, with surplus plasma sold off-world and directly to the Trade Federation. Theed Spaceport is also expanded by ORCA as part of Damask Holding's business venture with Naboo.","According to Nexus of Power, which is set in the Imperial Era that begun in 19 BBY as dated by Star Wars: Galactic Atlas, the Jedi credited Ossus as having been their cultural center for a 12,000 year period. As such, it could also be calculated that Ossus came to be the Jedi's cultural center in approximately 12,000 BBY., Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Master & Apprentice gives the age of Obi-Wan Kenobi as seventeen years old, while Star Wars: Card Trader establishes that Kenobi was born fifty-seven years before the Battle of Yavin, which is placed in 0 BBY by Star Wars: Galactic Atlas. Kenobi's birth year can therefore be dated to 57 BBY, placing Master & Apprentice in 40 BBY. Qui-Gon Jinn is stated to be forty years old during Master & Apprentice, meaning he was born circa 80 BBY. The script of Dooku: Jedi Lost states that members of Jedi Initiate Clans are the same age, and as Ky Narec is in the same clan as Jinn, it can be deduced that Narec was also born circa 80 BBY., Star Wars Journeys: Beginnings",0,Canon,1,0,Other

Star Wars: Galactic Atlas dates the founding of the Galactic Empire to 19 BBY. In Doctor Aphra 32, Chelli Aphra and her mother, Lona Aphra, left the Second Moon of Thrinittik during the Empire's existence. The comic issue also established that the pair lived on the planet for 2 years before Lona Aphra's death, which means that Lona had to die roughly during or after 17 BBY. The assault on the Mako-Ta Space Docks, according to Ultimate Star Wars, New Edition, occured around one year after the mission to steal the Death Star plans. As Star Wars: Galactic Atlas dates the mission to 0 BBY, the assault must have occurred in 1 ABY.

If Doctor Aphra 12 took place in 1 ABY, it would mean that Lona died in 17 BBY, fulfilling the above information. Additionally, Doctor Aphra 32 also has a flashback sequence depicting Lona Aphra's death 18 years prior to the events of the comic.
